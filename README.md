# 3D Maze Mesh Generation
This a simple toy project where I mess around with procedural generation and the creation of meshes for random mazes. The first type is a cubic maze, which can either be as an interconected set of 2D mazes covering the surface, or as a fully 3D maze with 6 movement options at each point in the maze. The other version, which I personally find more visually and mathmatically interesting, is the spherical maze which I hope to incorporate into a game at some point. This works by first tesselating the surface of a sphere by projecting evenly distributed points on a cube onto the surface of the sphere. The advantage of this projection is that it allows me to tile the sphere with fairly regular quadritalerals which matches my abstraction of a maze making it easier to construct the walls onto the sphere. If you are interested in the mathmatics of the projection I would recommend this [blog post](http://mathproofs.blogspot.com/2005/07/mapping-cube-to-sphere.html).
